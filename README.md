**AI-Driven Employee Burnout Risk Analysis**

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to analyze and predict employee burnout using work patterns, stress indicators, recovery metrics, and performance data. The goal is to enable proactive HR intervention and reduce productivity loss and attrition.

**Phase 1: Dataset Engineering & Feature Understanding**

**Objective:**
Design a meaningful dataset to support burnout prediction and HR decision-making.

Burnout Dimensions:

•	Workload
•	Stress
•	Recovery
•	Performance & Engagement

Dataset Features:
| Column Name        | Dimension    | What it Measures                              | Why it Matters for Burnout |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| avg_daily_hours    | Workload    | Average working hours per day                 | Prolonged working hours increase fatigue and burnout risk |
| overtime_hours     | Workload    | Average overtime hours worked                 | Sustained overtime indicates excessive work pressure |
| sleep_hours        | Recovery    | Average hours of sleep per day                | Insufficient sleep reduces recovery and accelerates burnout |
| stress_level       | Stress      | Self-reported stress level                    | High stress has a direct psychological impact on burnout |
| engagement_score   | Engagement  | Level of employee involvement and motivation  | Declining engagement is an early indicator of burnout |
| productivity_score | Performance | Quality and efficiency of work output         | Burnout negatively impacts productivity and performance |

Outcome of Phase 1:

•	Dataset structure finalized
•	Features aligned with burnout dimensions
•	Ready for data generation and modeling
